# Web2DAO

One of the main challenges currently facing the mass adoption of blockchain technology is the difficulty in using it. Tasks such as creating a wallet, managing private keys, and understanding technical terms like "gas fees" and "gas price" can be overwhelming for many people, making it challenging for them to access the benefits of blockchain such as immutability and transparency.

To address this challenge, Web2DAO is designed to bridge the gap between Web3 and Web2 by reducing the complexity in the user experience. It achieves this by integrating user-friendly features such as social logins and gasless transactions, allowing users to interact with blockchain applications in a more familiar and intuitive way, similar to how they use Web2 applications.

By making the process of using blockchain technology more accessible and less intimidating, Web2DAO aims to encourage more people to embrace the benefits of blockchain and take advantage of the opportunities it presents. With a simplified user experience, people can more easily participate in decentralized applications and leverage the unique advantages of blockchain technology.
